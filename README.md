# project-todolist
See it hosted live (WIP) @ https://pedronarbondo.github.io/project-todolist/

Honestly, I underestimated this project.

After staring at the code for a while, I realized it was a great exercise to implement object constructors, classes, DOM manipulation skills, CSS, everything so far.
It's still a WiP, so new functionalities will be added as time passes.
